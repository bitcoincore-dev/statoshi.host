Like it's inspiration PGP, GPG uses public-key cryptography where each user owns two keys: for decryption (public key) and for encryption (private key). This cheatsheet is for quick reference and gives a brief description of that could be done with this security tool. Keys management GPG has several switches that allows to generate a public-private keypar, revoke and delete keys. The viewing public and private keys are also supported. Generate key pair To generate a public-private key pair in the GPG keyring use the \u2013gen-key switch. The below command will prompt for some details such the key-type, key-size, user ID to identify the key and the time period over which the generated key will be valid: gpg --gen-key Revoke keys In case if the secret key has been stolen, an existing key could be revoked with \u2013gen-revoke switch. To be able to do this, is is needed for a secret key: gpg --gen-revoke Delete keys The below commands are used to delete public and private keys from GPG keyring: gpg --delete-key KeyID gpg --delete-secret-key KeyID gpg --delete-secret-and-public-key KeyID View keys To view all types of keys, issue the command: gpg --list-key gpg --list-public-keys gpg --list-secret-keys Keys manipulations GPG allows several key manipulation functions such importing and exporting the keys. Sending and receiving keys from server are also supported. Export a private key to a file gpg --export-secret-key -a > file.out Export a public key in a file gpg --export --armor KeyID > file.out Import a private key from a file gpg --import --allow-secret-key-import file.in Import a public key from a file gpg --import file.in Send a public key to a server gpg --keyserver dbma.keyserver.ca --send-key KeyID Get a Key from a server gpg --keyserver dbma.keyserver.ca --recv-keys KeyID Cryptographic options GPG allows file encryption and decryption. Another option is support for file signing that makes this program an alternative to PGP. Encrypt, decrypt and sign gpg -r KeyID -e -a -o file.out file.in Decrypt file gpg -r KeyID -d -o file.out file.in Create signature of a file gpg -b -a KeyID -o file.out file.in Also, you might check the GUI frontends for GnuPG for easy GPG management","title":"Home"},{"location":"#gpg-cheatsheet","text":"GPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard and it is vital tool for everyone who wants to protect the email and files.
